The features that the assistant should focus on include some general information: architecture, core clock frequency, operating voltage, power consumptio; performace charachteristics: processing power, memory size, debugging support; peripherals: ADC and DAC descriptions, type of timer used, communication interfaces like SPI,I2C; security: encryption schema, secure boot",
